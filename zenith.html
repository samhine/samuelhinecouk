                          Welcome to Zenith. This add-on aims to bridge the gap
                          between League of Legends analysts and the Riot API.
                          Classically, analysts (or data analysts) will collect
                          data into CSV from Python/R/Java and then import this
                          into sheets. Zenith aims to cut out the middle man,
                          allowing API requests to be made directly from Sheets.
                          <br />

                    To get started you will need to create a
                    <code>Credentials</code> tab within your sheet to which
                    Zenith is connected.
                    <br />
                    Then place;
                    <br />
                    - your chosen region/platform in cell <strong>A2</strong>.
                    You can find a list of supported regions

                    <br />
                    - your Riot API key in cell <strong>B2</strong>. Zenith
                    stores your API key to be sent off with your requests - it
                    is <strong>never</strong> stored persistently.
                    <br />
                    You may change either of these values at any time.

                Zenith adds custom functions to your sheets environment. They
                behave similarly to built in sheets functions such as
                <code>=SUM()</code> or <code>=VLOOKUP()</code>. Documentation
                for all user facing Zenith methods are included in tooltips that
                appear while typing methods.

                Although rate limiting is built in to Zenith, there are some
                ways <strong>you</strong> can limit the chance of throttling
                your project;
                <br />
                - Once you have gathered data that need not change (or make
                extra calls to Zenith), copy this data and
                <strong>paste as value</strong>. This prevents cells from
                spamming Zenith and consequently the API when that data doesn't
                actually need to be updated.
                <br />
                - Limit cell dependancies. This means that you have as few cells
                as possible waiting for another cell to load. Pass by value
                wherever possible, rather than by cell.
