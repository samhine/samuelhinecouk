							<p>Although franchising comes nowhere close to UK University Esports, I found this talk particularly interesting. Hearing what industry professionals have to say was a lot more insightful than shouting down the mic with my friends on Discord.
							<br><br>
							Esports franchising (as generally described by the panellists) is the implication that an organisation can permanently feature in an esports league. The beginning of the conference mainly discussed how franchising in the US is already becoming established (e.g. NALCS), and now the esports organisations there place a larger focus on business since their participation in the tournaments are certain.
							<br><br>
							To me, whether one decides they are “on-board” with the franchising of leagues comes down to this point – does the security of an organisation in a tournament further encourage new talent and is it more entertaining for the viewers?
							<br><br>
							A point which certainly resounds with me is that matches between two franchised orgs seem far less important. Both have secured their spot, and there’s little to no risk one of the teams is being removed from it anytime soon. The sheer number of matches in something similar to the NALCS is pretty overwhelming, to the point where it is only really reasonable to follow the teams you care about. This leads on nicely to how viewers align themselves with the professional scene. In my experience, is it more common for viewers for be fans of individual players rather than of organisations, of course this is purely anecdotal, but it’s something organisations must think about. Ultimately, do you make the decision to keep fans from continuing the roster, or include new talent to win?
							<br><br>
							The difference in acquiring talent in franchised leagues also has both it’s advantages and disadvantages. From the perspective of new players, you now have a slightly more structured path in your career – get hired by one of the top organisations. The sad thing is that there is a ceiling at which a player can progress with unfranchised brands; and with decisions being made to continue rosters to keep fans happy, it’s a hard ceiling to break through.
							<br><br>
							The argument can be made that franchising encourages organisations to become riskier with new roster picks, but in my amateur view I have a feeling most will choose to stick with what’s safe, and what they know the fans would love.
							<br><br>
							My personal opinion falls to this; franchising doesn't sit right with me. I'm sure it makes more business sense in most scenarios, but it seem to unintentionally take away from what to me is at the core of competitive gaming - meritocracy. The thing I love about open leagues is the ability of a team of 5 friends to get together, decide they want to be the best, and do it. However unlikely that may be, it should be possible.

							<p>Whenever the topic of UK Esports comes up, I always get excited. Not only because it’s my home country, but because the likelihood of university esports coming up is far more likely.
							<br><br>
							It’s commonly known that esports has mostly grown in the complete wrong direction, the big leagues with the best players were established far before the university and high school ones. It’s great to see so many established individuals on the panel all looking towards the university scene and giving their encouragement.
							<br><br>
							In my view, it’s all about being patient. There are very few brands who have fully immersed themselves with the collegiate scene (OCUK, noblechairs, ASUS ROG), as it’s understandable – it’s hard to know what the fuck is going on. Personally, I’m doing my best (as best a university organisation can) to grow organisations’ interest in the scene and incentivise them to get involved. Of course, there are limits to not only what I’m able to do, but what I’m capable of (they’re different, trust me). As well as obvious time constraints of being a university student, I’m going to be far less experienced that other competing and more secure (semi) pro league organisations. 
							<br><br>
							Something which is often mentioned alongside the university topic is the passion of those willing to get involved. Many leaders/committee members of these university societies are dedicated tens of hours a week to try and grow/market/improve their brand with little to no reward or recognition. There are whispers in the air of organisations taking more note of student effort, but even then, the collegiate scene is so saturated with passion, it’s becoming harder and harder to stand out. Keep in mind however, that this is a great thing for companies, organisations, and the collegiate scene in general.
							<br><br>
							The speakers were asked to give their 5-year predictions of the UK scene, so I’ll hop in and give my own. My guess is that since esports has just been supported but BUCS, that universities start to take things a little more seriously. There will be esports arms of the university rather than of the students’ unions, and a lot more money will be given to student organisers to help brand themselves against the university and throw more impressive events. This will bring in sponsors (endemic and otherwise) since being involved with a university and esports is an absolutely huge marketing opportunity
