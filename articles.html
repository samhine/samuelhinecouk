							At the start of the summer split, a few people took to twitter to express their perceived rankings of teams before the games had started. Here, we'll take a look at these rankings, their differences to the current score table, and the metrics we can use measure their "correctness".
							<br><br>
							<b>The Problem</b>
							<br>
							We have a table of predictions (specifically 9 UKLC teams) who's order determines their performance rankings. We'd like to generate a robust metric which can measure the "wrongness" of a table of predictions compared to their true value. In other areas on statistics, performance metrics are usually based on their "distance" from the true values (where distance can be defined in a number of ways), and are useful for the training/analysis of models, such as neural networks and other areas of machine learning. In our case, we're not so much worried about using a metric to train a model, just to find out who's been the "most correct" so far in their initial rankings.
							<br><br>
							<b>The Data</b>
							<br>
							After searching Twitter, I managed to wrangle 5 tier lists which users had put out, those users being Aux (<a href="https://twitter.com/AuxCasts/status/1145065812006449152/photo/1">@AuxCasts</a>), Crane (<a href="https://twitter.com/CraneLoL/status/1143594871518846976/photo/2">@CraneLoL</a>), Viggo (<a href="https://twitter.com/ViggoEdits/status/1144349586796032005/photo/1">@ViggoEdits</a>), Snuggli (<a href="https://twitter.com/Snuggli_/status/1144698061433782274">@Snuggli_</a>) and Royal (<a href="https://twitter.com/royalwinsmid/status/1143934789537472512">@royalwinsmid</a>). These are the tier lists I'll be using for my analysis.
							All 5 of their predictions can be found below;

							<b>The Method</b>
							<br>
							There are a few ideas I have personally for how this could be approached. The first (and most obvious) approach would be calculate the <i>sum of differences</i> for each of the prediction tables compared to the current true table. So, if someone was completely correct in their predictions but 1st and 2nd were switched, their score would be 2, since their 1st place prediction was 1 slot away, as well as their 2nd place prediction. One could simply divide this by 2 (which I'd imagine would seem more sensible in most peoples head), so I'll apply this transformation at the end.
							<br>
							The second method that comes to mind is calculating the amount of "switches" required for a predictions table for it to match the current true table. So, for example, if the rankings `1, 2, 3, 4` were correct, and someone had predicted `2, 4, 3, 1`, their score would be 2, since two switches (1 and 2, then 2 and 4) would render the table correct.
							<br>
							Each of these metrics have their downfalls. The second metric is great at telling us the complexity of "wrongness" of the predictions, but treats predictions such as `1, 3, 2, 4` and `4, 2, 3, 1` as equal when in most cases the second should be punished more. In this example, I'll choose to mainly focus on the first metric (which we'll now refer to as the "sum of differences") rather than the second.
							<br><br>
							<b>The Results</b>
							<br>
							For the results, I'll choose Aux's predictions and walk through the calculation of his score. Here are his predictions and the current true table side by side, with differences marked.

						  Starting with the first prediction, we find the distance to the matching team in the true table, in this case 2. <br>
						  For the second prediction, this distance is 1. <br>
						  For the third, 1 and so on... <br>
							<br>
 							In the end Aux's differences total 12, which means his final score is 6.
							<br>
 							We can apply the same metric to the other 4 predictions table which give the resultant scores;

							<br><br>
							<b>Limitations and Extensions</b>
							<br>
							An obvious limitation is that in actuality, the bottom 3 teams all sit at 0 points. This means that the difference calculation for these three teams is a little skewed in favour of those guessed the bottom teams correctly. This should simply be noted, I'll probably come back to this at the end of the season when the point table is more distributed, and more concerete assumptions about brain sizes can be made.
							<br>
							There are a few extensions I can think of, mainly involving weightings. For example, wrong guesses towards the top of table could have more of an impact on score than wrong guesses towards the bottom.
							Subjectively, switching 1st and 2nd is a lot more meaningful than 7th and 8th. Also, weightings on how <i>close</i> two teams are together (in terms of points). If Team A trials Team B by 1 point, and Team C trials Team B by 20 points, mistaking their positions should have different levels of meanings.

							<p>Over the past few weeks, I've had the fantastic opportunity to work with player and game data as part as my role with <a href="https://twitter.com/DiabolusEsports">Diabolus</a>. As fun as grinding out player statistics and tendencies is, I thought I'd take a step back and see what trends I could identify within the UKLC game data itself, and how well this matches up with what is commonly believed.
							Although there are many statistics to choose from, as a support main warding has more of an impact on my playstyle than most. Before getting into the nitty gritty of warding based stats, there are a few things of interest to note for the UKLC games so far.
							<br><br>
							<b>Blue/Red win rates</b>
							<br>
							For the 24 games that have been played in the UKLC (up to Week 4), only 9 games have featured a blue side victory. This means teams placed on red side have a 62.50% chance of winning*. This isn't so much in line with general SoloQ statistics - where <a href="https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/blue-vs-red/na">blue side has a slightly advantageous ~52% win rate</a>.
							<br><br>
							But where does this difference come from in SoloQ? I've recruited the help of a couple of big brains from <a href="https://twitter.com/DiabolusEsports">Diabolus</a> to help me explain some of the more in-depth game knowledge. He's my long time esports partner Jack (<a href="https://twitter.com/DBL_Coach">@DBL_Coach</a>) explaining this difference in win rate, and why it occurs.
							<blockquote>
								Generally speaking, blue is the historically stronger side. It's been notoriously strong in pro play because of first pick value, but also because of the the map-state which is what affects the solo queue winrate. What I'm alluding to here is specifically the way botlane is shaped. The tri brush gives very easy access to both dragon and the river, but also gives the jungler two ganks paths to bot. This results in an easier enforcement of what most players understand as 'better not wins'. There's several other factors however the ease of ganks and movement around blueside bottom lane is what stands out when you really conceptualise the map.
					    </blockquote>
							Although interesting, since the SoloQ statistics are so balanced, I will choose to discard this as a consideration within the analysis.
							<br><br>
							<b>Other considerations</b>
							<br>
							When analysing whether higher ward placement rates are conducive to winning games, we must also consider to converse case - "do teams ward more when they are winning?". Unfortunately, timeline data is not available for UKLC games so further investigation to the rate of ward placements after some winning indicator (such as gold lead) is not possible. So, this possibility is just a factor to consider throughout. It is also very strange to consider a univariate analysis (that is, only focusing on one variable) for a game as complicated as League of Legends, since there are obviously many co-dependent variables within a game instance which contribute to the victory or defeat of a team. Without trying to be to political, this is also a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464884915593234">common problem</a> in many attention grabbing news headlines, where journalists tend to focus purely on one statistic and treat it as the governing factor without considering a multivariate analysis. <br>
							In this case, I'll simply acknowledge that the consideration of <i>only</i> wards in a game may be ignorant, but for exploration's sake it's still a worthwhile endeavor.
							</p>
							<br>
							<b>What is warding?</b>
							<br>
							For the few readers who aren't up to scratch on their League of Legends knowledge, I've got Kasey (<a href="https://twitter.com/_WEEXIAO">@_WEEXIAO</a>) to tell us more about warding, and why it's important.
							<blockquote>
								In its most fundamental form, warding is the control of opportunity in League of Legends. Placing a ward lessens the fog of war on the map for your team, and thus increases your potential knowledge over map circumstances as it relates to the enemy team and neutral objectives. For competitive teamplay, there are two main benefits that warding provides for your team:
								<br>
								    1. Positional advantages
								<br>
								    2. Informational Advantage
								<br>
								The two forms of advantages that warding provides are not mutually exclusive - on the other hand, they tie into each other. An easy way to think of it would be micro information (positioning and etc) and macro information (knowledge that influences decision making), with the two tying into another. As a whole, the reason why warding is important is simple: warding provides details about the game state, which increases a team's sense of agency.
					    </blockquote>
							<b>Approach</b>
							<br>
							First of all, the warding data must be found for each game "instance". We'll record for each player of a game how many wards they placed, and how many they destroyed and label whether they were victorious. We can plot this simply as wards placed against wards destroyed, and colour each data point by win status.
							<br>
							<img class="center" src="images/wards_indiv.png" alt="alt text"/>
							<br>
							From the scatter plot there are no obvious trends, mainly because we're mixing support warding statistics along with other roles. Since we have no indication of which lane we're pulling data from (and it would be messy to do so), this is obviously less than helpful for our investigation. A sensible idea might be to use summary statistics within each game instance to find total warding statistics for an entire team within a game, rather than for individuals.
							<br> <!-- plot here -->
							<img class="center" src="images/wards_team.png" alt="alt text"/>
							<br>
							Although a lot easier to digest, this is also unhelpful. It's not easy to discern whether higher rates of warding (points more to the left) suggests a higher win rate. There is one more factor to consider while doing this kind of analysis - game length. The flaring of the scatter plots suggests fewer games have high rates of warding, likely due to the small amount of games that go on for a longer period. To combat this problem, we'll simply find the wards placed/destroyed per minute by each team for each game.
							<br> <!-- plot here -->
							<img class="center" src="images/wards_team_per_minute.png" alt="alt text"/>
							<br>
							This is still a little bit messy, but we're no longer suffering from the flaring (or "right facing trumpet") as seen in the previous "time ignorant" graphs. Overall, we can see that the graph is <i>slightly</i> more red on the lower left, and <i>slightly</i> more blue on the upper right. It may help to have more game data, but from this simple analysis we can <i>sort of</i> see that higher warding rates do indicate a higher win rate.
							<br><br>
							<b>Summary</b>
							<br>
							There's a reason for my cautious language use throughout this article, usually making claims in the statistical world requires modelling, and performance analysis thereof. Since we only have 48 data points (24 games) any modelling on a scatter plot as varied as the above is likely not to render any useful result. But, informed speculation is still fun.
							<br><br>
							Some interesting notes;
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
							<li> <b>·</b> The highest warding rate of any game was achieved by Excel against Fnatic, the 24th match of the split (4.46 wards placed per minute against 3.94 from FNC). </li>
							<li> <b>·</b> The lowest warding rate of any game was "achieved" by Barrage against Phelan, the 18th match of the split (2.11 wards placed per minute against 3.04 from PHL). </li>
							<li> <b>·</b> Out of the 24 games, only 8 were won by the team with the lower warding rate. </li>
							<li> <b>·</b> The highest warding rate of any player was FNC support Prosfair against XL (game 24) with 2.01 wards per minute. </li>
							<li> <b>·</b> The lowest warding rate of any player was NVE jungler Infinity against MNM (game 20) with 0.15 wards per minute. </li>
							</ul>

							<p>Although franchising comes nowhere close to UK University Esports, I found this talk particularly interesting. Hearing what industry professionals have to say was a lot more insightful than shouting down the mic with my friends on Discord.
							<br><br>
							Esports franchising (as generally described by the panellists) is the implication that an organisation can permanently feature in an esports league. The beginning of the conference mainly discussed how franchising in the US is already becoming established (e.g. NALCS), and now the esports organisations there place a larger focus on business since their participation in the tournaments are certain.
							<br><br>
							To me, whether one decides they are “on-board” with the franchising of leagues comes down to this point – does the security of an organisation in a tournament further encourage new talent and is it more entertaining for the viewers?
							<br><br>
							A point which certainly resounds with me is that matches between two franchised orgs seem far less important. Both have secured their spot, and there’s little to no risk one of the teams is being removed from it anytime soon. The sheer number of matches in something similar to the NALCS is pretty overwhelming, to the point where it is only really reasonable to follow the teams you care about. This leads on nicely to how viewers align themselves with the professional scene. In my experience, is it more common for viewers for be fans of individual players rather than of organisations, of course this is purely anecdotal, but it’s something organisations must think about. Ultimately, do you make the decision to keep fans from continuing the roster, or include new talent to win?
							<br><br>
							The difference in acquiring talent in franchised leagues also has both it’s advantages and disadvantages. From the perspective of new players, you now have a slightly more structured path in your career – get hired by one of the top organisations. The sad thing is that there is a ceiling at which a player can progress with unfranchised brands; and with decisions being made to continue rosters to keep fans happy, it’s a hard ceiling to break through.
							<br><br>
							The argument can be made that franchising encourages organisations to become riskier with new roster picks, but in my amateur view I have a feeling most will choose to stick with what’s safe, and what they know the fans would love.
							<br><br>
							My personal opinion falls to this; franchising doesn't sit right with me. I'm sure it makes more business sense in most scenarios, but it seem to unintentionally take away from what to me is at the core of competitive gaming - meritocracy. The thing I love about open leagues is the ability of a team of 5 friends to get together, decide they want to be the best, and do it. However unlikely that may be, it should be possible.

							<p>Whenever the topic of UK Esports comes up, I always get excited. Not only because it’s my home country, but because the likelihood of university esports coming up is far more likely.
							<br><br>
							It’s commonly known that esports has mostly grown in the complete wrong direction, the big leagues with the best players were established far before the university and high school ones. It’s great to see so many established individuals on the panel all looking towards the university scene and giving their encouragement.
							<br><br>
							In my view, it’s all about being patient. There are very few brands who have fully immersed themselves with the collegiate scene (OCUK, noblechairs, ASUS ROG), as it’s understandable – it’s hard to know what the fuck is going on. Personally, I’m doing my best (as best a university organisation can) to grow organisations’ interest in the scene and incentivise them to get involved. Of course, there are limits to not only what I’m able to do, but what I’m capable of (they’re different, trust me). As well as obvious time constraints of being a university student, I’m going to be far less experienced that other competing and more secure (semi) pro league organisations.
							<br><br>
							Something which is often mentioned alongside the university topic is the passion of those willing to get involved. Many leaders/committee members of these university societies are dedicated tens of hours a week to try and grow/market/improve their brand with little to no reward or recognition. There are whispers in the air of organisations taking more note of student effort, but even then, the collegiate scene is so saturated with passion, it’s becoming harder and harder to stand out. Keep in mind however, that this is a great thing for companies, organisations, and the collegiate scene in general.
							<br><br>
							The speakers were asked to give their 5-year predictions of the UK scene, so I’ll hop in and give my own. My guess is that since esports has just been supported but BUCS, that universities start to take things a little more seriously. There will be esports arms of the university rather than of the students’ unions, and a lot more money will be given to student organisers to help brand themselves against the university and throw more impressive events. This will bring in sponsors (endemic and otherwise) since being involved with a university and esports is an absolutely huge marketing opportunity
